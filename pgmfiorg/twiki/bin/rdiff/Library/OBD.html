<strong>On Board Diagnostics - General Overview</strong>
<p />
In an effort to reduce vehicle emissions, the California Air Resource Board
(CARB) required that an on board diagnostic system be added to all cars sold in
California beginning in 1988. These systems were to monitor the effectiveness of
the emission control system and notify the driver if a problem existed with the
emission control systems. The first generation on board diagnostic systems were
very basic, and became a building block for the current second generation systems.
<p />
<strong>On Board Diagnostics – I</strong>
<p />
General Information
<p />
CARB mandated that starting in 1988, all cars sold in California would be
equipped with an on board emissions testing system. The system had to illuminate
a "check engine" light to notify the driver of potential failures on emission components
and systems and store a diagnostic trouble code (DTC) in memory. This
system is now referred to as On Board Diagnostics - First Generation (<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I).
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I systems were required to monitor all inputs for a high / low range, the
EGR system, the oxygen (O2) sensor, the fuel metering system, and the engine
control module (ECM). The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I regulations were relatively easy for most
manufacturers to comply with since most manufacturers were already monitoring
these systems. Many manufacturers were monitoring ECM operation, and storing
DTCs as early as 1980. Data stream was also available on many domestic cars in
the mid 1980s even though it was not required until the introduction of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
systems in 1996.
The first Honda PGMFI systems used in 1985 complied with <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I regulations
that did not go into effect until 1988. They monitored for fuel and emissions input
malfunctions and stored a DTC when one was detected. DTC retrieval was done
by counting the number of blinks from a light on either the dash, or the ECM itself.
A 3-pin data link connector (<a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a>) was added to 1992 Civics and Preludes for retrieval
of data from the ECM. The 3-pin <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> was added to Accords in 1994. This
<a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> was the forerunner to the 16-pin <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II connector. To retrieve data from
this <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a>, you need a scan tool that is compatible with the Honda system. The
Mastertech scan tool (utilizing the Honda/Acura aftermarket software) can be
used. Other scan tools may be able to use this 3-pin <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a>, check your operating
manual.
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I system was a starting point and had much room for improvement. The
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems addressed all the shortcomings of the earlier <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I systems. The
most significant shortcomings of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I systems were:
<p />
No consistency of DTCs
<p />
The assigning of DTCs for specific malfunctions was left up to each manufacturer.
There was no consistency in the DTCs used from manufacturer to manufacturer.
<p />
No consistency in the <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a>
<p />
For the manufacturers that offered data stream, there was no consistency in the
<a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a>. The location, number of pins, and shape of the <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> usually varied from
manufacturer to manufacturer. This required a different scan tool cable for each
major manufacturer.
<p />
No consistency in DTC retrieval protocol
<p />
For the manufacturers that offered data stream, the protocol used by the scan tool
to retrieve information was not consistent. This required the scan tool manufacturers
to have a different program for each manufacturer.
<p />
Unable to Detect Emissions System Degradation
<p />
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I systems only checked input signals for extreme highs and lows. Many
components would degrade to the point that they were creating increased emissions,
but were not detected by the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I system.
<p />
<strong>On Board Diagnostics – II</strong>
<p />
General Information
<p />
At the same time the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I regulations went into effect, the standards for a second
generation on-board diagnostic system (<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II) were released. The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
standards were initially developed by CARB and the Society of Automotive Engineers
(SAE). Their roles were as follows:
<p />
CARB SAE
<p />
Developed:
<p />
All the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II requirements for the
manufacturers. All the rules, regulations,
and requirements of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system
were set forth in the California Code of
Regulations:
<p />
Title 13 Section 1968
<p />
Developed:
J1962 <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> Location / Scanner Protocols
J1930 Diagnostic / Component Terminology
J1979 Diagnostic Test Modes
J2012 DTC Standardization
J2190 Diagnostic Test Modes
<p />
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system is much more complicated and powerful than the earlier
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I systems. The implementation of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems has been a challenge for
the automotive industry with both the manufacturers and the service techs.
The "target" date for the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems was 1994. The automotive industry was
behind schedule on developing these systems and the mandatory year for <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
was pushed back to 1996. There were a few 1994 models (no Hondas) that had
the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system. The first <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system used by Honda was on a 1995 V-6
Accord. All Honda models went <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II in 1996.
In actuality, every single model did not go full <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II compliant in 1996. Many
manufacturers petitioned CARB for waivers on certain parts of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system.
It is not uncommon to find 96 and up vehicles that do not have every <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
component installed and working per <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations. CARB and EPA set
1998 as the year that all cars must have every component.
<p />
Features
<p />
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system does all that the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I system did, plus it has many more
powerful features. Improvements were made in all areas with the biggest change
in the actual monitoring techniques. The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system added ECM run tests,
called monitors, that can test an entire subsystem for performance. Let's take a
look at all the key features of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems.
<p />
Common Component Terminology
<p />
Most cars have components that perform the same function as a similar components
on a different make car. These components may be called something different
by each manufacturer. <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II established a common component terminology.
This makes it easier for service techs that have to work on many different models.
Here is a list of the Honda components that got new <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II names:

</table>
<p />
Common DTC Terminology
Under the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I system all the DTCs were different among manufacturers. The
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations specified a common DTC numbering scheme. The SAE
J2012 standard established the DTC numbering scheme. The DTC numbering
scheme is covered in detail in the DTC / MIL / Freeze Frame Training Module.
<p />
Common <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> and Protocol
Prior to <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II, each manufacturer was free to use any <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> configuration and
any scan tool protocol. This required a different cable and software for most
manufacturers. The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations standardizes the <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> and the protocol.
These regulations are based on the SAE J1962, J1979, and J2190 standards.
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> is a standardized 16-pin connector that is accessible by using
no tools, located along the edge of the dash, and is visible while squatting.
A standard protocol means that the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II information can be retrieved from any
car using a generic <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II compliant scan tool. Only a few wires in the <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> are
used for <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II and the remaining pin locations are free to be used by the manufacturer
any way they want. Many manufacturers use the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> for access
to advanced diagnostic information. This information may not necessarily follow
the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II protocols. Only the information that has been specified by <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
regulations has to be available at the <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> using an <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II scanner protocol.
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II <a href="../../view/Library/DLC.html">DLC</a> and scan tool protocols are covered in greater detail in the Scan
<p />
Tool Training Module.
<p />
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system is capable of storing some historical data. The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system
monitors the deviation of the actual fuel injector's pulse width (PW) from the factory
default base pulse width. It records this deviation as a parameter called long
term fuel trim (LT FT). This information is used to trim the fuel while the engine
is being run in the open loop (OL) mode. The information can also be used to detect
problems with the fuel delivery system by the service techs.
The LTFT parameter is covered in greater detail in the Fuel System Monitor
Training Module.
<p />
Expanded Malfunction Indicator Light
<p />
The operation of the malfunction indicator light (MIL) has changed significantly
under the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system.
Illuminating the MIL
Prior to <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II, when a malfunction occurred the MIL was illuminated.
With the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system, a malfunction may be required to occur on as
many as three consecutive trips before the MIL is illuminated.
Extinguishing the MIL
Prior to <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II, the MIL was extinguished when the car was recranked.
The MIL would not come back on unless the problem still existed. With
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II, the MIL is not extinguished until the fault does not re-occur on
three consecutive trips.
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II MIL will also flash when a condition is present that could cause
damage to the catalytic converter. This usually occurs during a misfire. The MIL
is covered in greater detail in the DTC / MIL / Freeze Frame Training Module.
<p />
Stored Freeze Frame Data
<p />
On of the more useful features of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system is its ability to take a snapshot
of the engine's parameters when a DTC is set. This feature is called a freeze
frame.
The system will capture a set of parameters when the first DTC is set. The freeze
frame will be held in memory until power is lost on the ECM or it is cleared with
a scan tool. Subsequent DTCs will not overwrite the freeze frame (unless it is a
high priority DTC). The ECM can store multiple DTCs but only one freeze frame,
which was taken at the first DTC. This is one of the reasons why after recording
the data on the freeze frame, you should clear it. If the freeze frame is not cleared
it will not be able to store any more data.
The freeze frame can be a great diagnostic tool since it is reflecting all the major
engine parameters that were present when the fault occurred. Using this information
a tech can try to "recreate" the situation that was present when the original
fault occurred.
The freeze frame is covered in greater detail in the DTC / MIL / Freeze Frame
Training Module.
<p />
Expanded Monitoring Capabilities
<p />
The expanded monitoring capabilities of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system is where the major
differences lie between <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I and <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II. In addition to monitoring input signals
for a high low value, the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system checks input signals for rationality
and output signals for functionality.
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system also has a whole set of tests that are run on subsystems under
certain conditions. The running of these monitors are controlled by the ECM programming.
Some of the tests are run continuously and some are run once per trip,
when certain enable criteria has been met.
The monitor requirements are specified in <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations, but how each
manufacturer accomplishes that is left up to the manufacturer. For example,
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations require that a car with an EGR system on it must test it, once
per trip for correct exhaust flow. How a manufacturer tests for proper flow is left
up to the manufacturer. Like some manufacturers, Honda activates the EGR and
watches for a change in the manifold absolute pressure (MAP) sensor input voltage.
Some manufacturers activate the EGR and watch for a change in the oxygen
content or a deviation in the engine's speed.
The main objective of an on board diagnostic system is was to detect the degradation
or failure of an emission component or system that could cause vehicle emissions
to rise by 50%. <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I was not catching degrading emissions components.
Here is a list of current monitors that are defined by <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations:
Monitor When Run
Comprehensive Component Monitor
This monitor checks all the input / output signals for a good
electrical signal. The comprehensive component monitor handles
all the electrical checks that were run by the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-I system.
To learn more about this monitor read the Comprehensive Component
Monitor module.
Continuous
Misfire Monitor
The misfire monitor checks the engine for signs of a misfire. The
monitor primarily looks for fluctuation in the speed of the engine's
crankshaft to determine if the engine is misfiring.
To learn more about this monitor read the Misfire Monitor module.
Continuous
Fuel System Monitor
The fuel system monitor compares the actual fuel injector PW
with the factory default base pulse width and reports any major
deviations.
To learn more about this monitor read the Fuel System Monitor
module.
Continuous
Catalyst Monitor
The catalyst monitor actually runs an efficiency test on the car's
catalytic converter once per trip. The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems have a
second O2 sensor located downstream of the catalytic converter.
The readings from this O2 sensor are compared to the upstream
O2 sensor to determine the catalyst's efficiency.
. To learn more about this monitor read the Catalyst Monitor
module.
Once Per
Trip
EGR Monitor
The EGR system is tested for proper EGR valve lift, and for
proper exhaust gas flow in the system
To learn more about this monitor read the EGR- Monitor module.
Once Per
Trip
Evaporative Monitor
The evaporative monitor checks the evaporative system for leaks
and proper purging. This monitor is a once per tip monitor and
to date has given most car manufacturers the most trouble.
To learn more about this monitor read the Evaporative Monitor
module..
Once Per
Trip
Oxygen Sensor Monitor
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system tests the primary O2 sensor once per tip for
its response time to rich and lean conditions. If the response time
is too slow or the O2 sensor values stays fixed high or low, the
system will store a DTC.
. To learn more about this monitor read the Oxygen Sensor
Monitor module.
Once Per
Trip
Oxygen Sensor Heater Monitor
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system checks once per trip to verify that the O2
sensor heaters are working properly. The monitor is typically run
right after the car is started.
To learn more about this monitor read the Oxygen Sensor Heater
Monitor module..
Once Per
Trip
<p />
The Politics of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
<p />
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system was a product of the Clean Air Act Amendment. One of the
main goals of the CAAA was to have in place an on-board diagnostic system that
was "universal" among car manufacturers. An equally important goal of the
CAAA was for all automotive service personnel to have access (at a fair market
price) to information and training about these systems. The standard was that any
training, support, guidance, or help given to the dealership techs was to be made
available (at a fair market price) to anybody else in the service industry. In some
ways this was accomplished, but in many ways it wasn't.
In my opinion here are two areas where the standardization and information accessibility
goals missed the mark:
<p />
What Is On The Car Is Not What You Expected
<p />
In theory a person should be able to read all the rules and regulations of the OBDII
system and have a good idea of what to expect under the hood of a car. That is
not always the case. Some of the issues that contribute to this are:
<p />
Waivers
The manufacturer's engineering departments were having a problem meeting the
deadline to get all the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II equipment working on every model line. The original
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II implementation date of 1994 was pushed back to 1996. Even by 1996,
some of the monitoring systems on some models was not developed to the satisfaction
of the engineers.
Each manufacturer was allowed two waivers in 1996 and one waiver in 1997 for a
specific <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II subsystem. If the manufacturer requested a waiver for a specific
subsystem and could provide engineering reports to show that the system was not
developed to the point that it was ready for production, a waiver was usually issued.
This means you may fully expect to see a certain feature on a car and not
find any part of that feature anywhere on the car!
Two more monitors will be added to cars between now and the year 2002.
The provisions also provide for a "phasing in" of these new monitors
<p />
Manufacturer's Interpretation
<p />
The "ground zero" document for <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II is CARB's Title 13 Section 1968 document.
It is 45 pages long and is written in a leegaleeze / government regulation
type format. Each manufacturer had to read the regulations and make their interpretation
of exactly what they had to do or not.
In many instances you will not find what you expected to find because the manufacturer
interpreted the regulation differently than you did. In some cases, manuVisit
facturer's interpretation has resulted in hefty fines from CARB/EPA who content
that the interpretation was outside the intent of the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulation.
<p />
Manufacturers Implementation
<p />
Contrary to what most people thought, the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II regulations did not specify
how a manufacturer was to comply with the requirements.
For example, the regulations state car as to be monitored for misfires, but
exactly how that is done is left up to the individual manufacturers. Some
look at crankshaft fluctuation, some look at O2 sensor waveforms, and
some even monitor the current in the secondary ignition system
<p />
Limited Access To Service Information
<p />
Included in the CAAA, along with the requirement for the implication of an
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system, was the accessibility to service information requirement. The
concept was that close to 75% of vehicle repairs are done outside the dealership
and to keep the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems operating properly all service techs needed this
service information.
In my humble opinion, I do not think this part of the CAAA has been implemented
as was intended by the authors of the CAAA and the Congress who voted
on the act. I will just leave it at that...
I have drawn a second conclusion about the accessibility of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II service information.
It is my opinion, but I think it is an accurate one. This issue actually
overshadows issues of the CAAA service information requirement. Since each
manufacturer implements the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II requirements slightly differently, many
manufacturers feel this information is a "trade secret" issue.
I do not know this for a fact, but my feeling is that the engineering department
wants to let nothing out, and the training department wants to pass enough information
along to its dealer techs so that they can properly diagnose and repair
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II systems. My observations are that some manufacturers do not give even
its own techs adequate <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II service information. My opinion is that this is due
to the engineering department not wanting this information to get outside the
dealership network and the safest thing to do would be to not tell anybody.
In some cases <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II training material developed by independent companies will
exceed the level of training given by the manufacturers to its own technicians.
<p />
The Future of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II
The <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system has worked well and is here to stay. The system will make
evolutional changes over the next few years. Two new monitors will be added
soon, the thermostat monitor and the PVC monitor. Two areas where <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II will
make some major changes are in the I/M programs and in the yet to be officially
named "OBD-III" program.
<p />
Integration With I/M Programs
<p />
<a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II does a good job in monitoring a car for malfunctions. When it is working
properly, it is actually more accurate than an emissions tail pipe test. Emissions
officials are tying to figure out how to use the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system in conjunction with
smog checks.
At present, most states will not allow a car to pass a smog check if the MIL is illuminated.
The next step will probably be to require the car to be scanned for any
stored DCTs. There are several pilot programs that are studying the feasibility of
requiring the readiness status of the monitors to be checked to confirm that they
have all ran to completion.
The most interesting pilot test going on now is one by CARB in which cars with
illuminated MILs are being run on an IM 240 test (the most stringent of the smog
checks) CARB and EPA wants to see how effective the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system is in
catching malfunctions. They want to test 500 cars, but have already tested close to
100. So far only 4 of the 100 cars that had illuminated MILs flunked an IM240
test. It looks like using the vehicles own <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II system may be more accurate
than even using a tail pipe test. This means in the future it may be that a car
comes in for an annual "scan tool" test instead of a tail pipe test. The advantages
here is that it is much faster for the customer and less expensive for the service
facility to provide.
<p />
<strong>OBD-III</strong>
<p />
As covered in the last section, <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II does a good job of monitoring for malfunctions.
So good that emissions experts are looking into the possibility of eliminating
the annual tailpipe test if they could figure out a way to get a customer to
bring a car in for repair when the MIL illuminates.
This next generation of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-II cars that report malfunctions are usually referred
to as <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-III cars. The implementation of this type of system is a long ways off,
not because of the technology, but because of civil liberty, freedom, and liability
issues. The goal of <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-III is to minimize the time delay between detection of a
malfunction by the <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-III system and the actual repair of the vehicle. Some of
the reporting technologies that are being studied are:
<p />
External Signal
<p />
The car would have some type of external indicator (like a light) that would indicate
the car was being driven around with an illuminated MIL. Apparently the
Visit Our Website: www.tech2tech.net Page
idea was to "shame" the owner into getting the car fixed. The civil liberties organizations
and the manufacturers are fighting this one. This idea will not be one
that will make it!
<p />
Driveability Modification
<p />
The idea to start having the car change its driveability the longer the owner went
without getting the car fixed. Something like slowly reduce the top speed until the
car is repaired. The civil liberties organizations and the manufacturers are fighting
this one too and it is highly unlikely that this idea will be used either.
<p />
On-Board Transmitter
<p />
If there is ever going to be an <a href="../../view/Library/OBD.html">OBD</a>-III, it will probably use an on-board transmitter
to report a MIL light on. The technology is available to handle this.
The most likely version will be the use of a roadside receiver to "query" cars as
they pass. GM Hughes Electronics has already tested a roadside unit that can
check every car on an eight lane interstate going 100 MPH. A violating car will
transmit its VIN and stored DTCs to the roadside receiver.
